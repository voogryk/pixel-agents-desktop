<br/>

Pixel Agents turns the AI coding agents running in your terminals into animated pixel-art characters working in a tiny office. They walk to their desks, sit down, type when they're editing files, read when they're searching, and flag you visually when they're stuck waiting for input.

It ships in two forms from the same codebase:

- **VS Code extension** — [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pablodelucca.pixel-agents) and [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/pablodelucca/pixel-agents). Agents launch into VS Code terminals; characters render in the panel area.
- **Standalone CLI** — `npx pixel-agents` starts a local server and serves the same office as a browser app, useful for tmux, remote, and non-VS Code workflows.

The architecture is fully agent-agnostic and editor-agnostic: a typed `HookProvider` interface defines the integration boundary so adding a new AI tool is a single subdirectory of code. Claude Code is the reference implementation today; Codex, Gemini, Cursor, and others are on the roadmap.

## Features

- **One agent, one character** — every Claude Code terminal gets its own animated character
- **Live activity tracking** — characters animate based on what the agent is actually doing (writing, reading, running commands)
- **Office layout editor** — design your office with floors, walls, and furniture using a built-in editor
- **Speech bubbles** — visual indicators when an agent is waiting for input or awaiting permission
- **Sound notifications** — optional chimes when an agent finishes its turn or requests permission
- **Sub-agents and Agent Teams** — see ephemeral sub-agents and persistent Claude teammates as separate characters, including team roles and lifecycle changes
- **Persistent layouts** — your office design is saved and shared across VS Code windows
- **Shared layout and assets** — import/export layouts and load external character, pet, and furniture packs
- **Areas** — paint named areas onto the office, map workspace folders to them, and new agents sit inside the areas mapped to their folder
- **Diverse characters** — 6 diverse characters. These are based on the amazing work of [JIK-A-4, Metro City](https://jik-a-4.itch.io/metrocity-free-topdown-character-pack).

## Where This Is Going

The vision is: play a game, build a product. Two goals follow from it: to build a familiar, intuitive interface for running and orchestrating a lot of agents; and to make the hours you spend doing it feel less like administration and more like play.

Roughly three stages get there:

1. **Everywhere, with everything.** Today it's Claude Code in VS Code or the browser. It should be whatever agent you run, wherever you work. A new CLI is a subdirectory, not a rewrite — this is where help is most useful right now.
2. **Actually a game.** Health bars for rate limits and token budgets. Scores for whatever you care about. Furniture that _does_ things. Offices you open like save files, one per project.
3. **Expand the orchestration frontier.** Orchestrator characters. Form a team by dragging a box around them. Hand work between agents. Point them at a board and let them pick up tasks themselves.

Most of this is still ahead. See [Issues](https://github.com/pixel-agents-hq/pixel-agents/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/pixel-agents-hq/pixel-agents/discussions) for what's open, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to jump in.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- **VS Code extension:** VS Code 1.105.0 or later
- **Standalone CLI:** Node.js 20 or later
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

## Getting Started

### VS Code extension

1. Install Pixel Agents from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pablodelucca.pixel-agents) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/pablodelucca/pixel-agents).
2. Open the **Pixel Agents** panel beside the terminal.
3. Click **+ Agent** to launch Claude Code. In a multi-root workspace, select the folder first.

To use Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, hover over **+ Agent** to find the **Skip permissions mode** button. Only use this when you accept the security implications.

Pixel Agents also detects Claude sessions started outside the extension. Turn on **Settings → Watch All Sessions** to include sessions from other workspaces.

### Standalone CLI

Run Pixel Agents from the workspace whose Claude sessions you want to see:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npx pixel-agents
```

The CLI chooses a free local port and prints the URL. Standalone does not launch Claude for you; start Claude Code in a terminal for the same workspace. To install the command globally instead:

```bash
npm install --global pixel-agents
pixel-agents
```

Use a fixed address or port when needed:

```bash
pixel-agents --port 3100
pixel-agents --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3100
pixel-agents --help
```

The default bind address is `127.0.0.1`. Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the UI and WebSocket to the local network; do this only on a trusted network.

Open the URL the CLI prints - it carries a `?token=` for this session. Any browser can watch the office without it, but installing or removing hooks (which edits your agent tool's own settings file, like the `~/.claude/settings.json`) is only offered to a session that has the token, so an untokened client on the network cannot approve it. Open the bare address instead and the hooks toggle in Settings is refused, and reports the actual install state rather than appearing to work.

Treat that URL as a secret: the token is a bearer capability, not proof of being local. Whoever holds it can approve the hook install from anywhere the server is reachable — so don't paste the URL into a shared channel, and note that it also lands in your browser history and (unredacted) in the server's own request log.

On macOS with iTerm2, clicking a character in the tokened session brings that agent's terminal tab to the front. The server maps the agent's Claude session id to a process (`claude agents --json`, falling back to `~/.claude/sessions/`), the process to its tty (`ps`), and the tty to an iTerm2 session via AppleScript — all local, nothing leaves the machine. The first click may prompt macOS to allow the terminal that runs the server to control iTerm2. Other terminals and platforms log a warning and do nothing.

Pass `--no-terminal` to disable the embedded terminal — watch agents without launching or attaching to them from the browser.

### Running the extension and standalone together

The extension and standalone CLI can run at the same time. Each server registers under `~/.pixel-agents/servers/`; the hook script sends events to all active registrations. VS Code and standalone keep separate agents, seats, and settings while using the shared office layout.

Stop a standalone server with **Ctrl+C**. It removes only its own registration.

## Customizing the Office

Click **Layout** to edit the office:

- Paint floor patterns and walls, with color and contrast controls.
- Place, rotate, recolor, select, and remove furniture.
- Paint auto-tiling carpets and customize their main and accent colors.
- Add animated pets; click a pet in the office to interact with it.
- Create named **Areas**, paint their tiles, and assign workspace folders to them.
- Undo/redo changes, then import or export the complete layout as JSON.

Layouts can grow to 64×64 tiles by clicking the ghost border outside the current grid.

### Office assets

Bundled furniture, floors, walls, carpets, characters, and pets live under `webview-ui/public/assets/`. Furniture manifests describe sprites, rotation groups, state groups, and animation frames.

Use **Settings → Add Asset Directory** to load external characters, pets, and furniture. See [docs/external-assets.md](docs/external-assets.md) for furniture directory structure and manifest details. The visual asset manager at `scripts/asset-manager.html` helps create furniture manifests.

## How It Works

Pixel Agents uses two Claude Code detection paths:

- **Hooks mode** (default) — a hook script receives Claude events such as `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `Stop`. It discovers active Pixel Agents servers and sends authenticated events to each one.
- **Heuristic mode** (fallback) — when hooks are unavailable, the runtime infers agent status by scanning Claude's JSONL session transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/`. Transcripts are also read in hooks mode for details not present in an event.

The Claude provider normalizes both sources into a shared `AgentEvent` model. `AgentRuntime` updates the central state store, and the active transport sends typed messages to the React webview. The office renders through Canvas 2D with pathfinding and character state machines.

Pixel Agents does not modify Claude Code. Its hook configuration and persistent data live under `~/.claude/` and `~/.pixel-agents/` respectively.

### Architecture

- **`core/`** — provider, adapter, transport, schema, and AsyncAPI message contracts with no runtime side effects.
- **`server/`** — shared Fastify server, agent runtime, persistence, Claude provider, transcript scanning, and standalone CLI.
- **`adapters/vscode/`** — the VS Code adapter: terminal, persistence, and webview bridge.
- **`webview-ui/`** — React 19, Vite, Canvas 2D, and adapter-specific transports for VS Code and browser WebSocket clients.

The extension and CLI are bundled with esbuild; the webview is built with Vite. Unit tests use Vitest and Node's test runner, and end-to-end coverage uses Playwright against VS Code and standalone.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixel-agents-hq/pixel-agents.git
cd pixel-agents
npm install
npm run build
```

Press **F5** in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host. To run the standalone bundle built from source:

```bash
node dist/cli.js
```

Common checks:

```bash
npm run check-types
npm run lint
npm test
npm run e2e
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development workflow and [e2e/README.md](e2e/README.md) for the end-to-end suite.

### Hosted Test Reports

Build the combined Allure report locally and stage it for Vercel:

```bash
npm run test
npm run e2e
npm run e2e -- --attach-videos-on-success
npm run vercel:prepare
```

Use `npm run test:report` to build the combined report without preparing the Vercel output, then `npm run test:report:open` to serve it locally.

The staged output serves the combined `e2e`, `server`, and `webview` Allure report at `/reports/allure/`; it does not include a standalone webview preview. GitHub Actions creates a Vercel Preview deployment only for same-repository pull requests targeting `main`. The deploy job expects `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets and skips fork pull requests.

## Troubleshooting

- **Standalone will not start:** verify Node.js 20+, omit `--port` to choose a free port, or select another fixed port.
- **An agent is missing:** confirm **Settings → Instant Detection (Hooks)** is on and that the session belongs to the current workspace. Enable **Watch All Sessions** if needed.
- **The UI looks disconnected:** open **Settings → Debug View** to inspect the server connection, transcript path, and latest agent data.
- **Extension and standalone are both running:** this is supported. Current versions create separate files under `~/.pixel-agents/servers/`; stopping one does not remove the other.
